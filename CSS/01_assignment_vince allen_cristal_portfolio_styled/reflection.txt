Challenges and Resolution

1. Aligning the Navigation Bar: One challenge I faced was getting the navigation list items to line up horizontally instead of stacking vertically. I realized that <li> tags are block-level elements by default, which causes them to take up the full width of their container. I resolved this by applying display: inline-block to the list items, which allowed them to sit side-by-side for a traditional menu look.
2. Removing Double Borders in Tables: The project table initially looked cluttered because the borders between the cells and the table itself were separated, creating a "double-line" effect. This made the data harder to read and the design feel outdated. I solved this by adding the border-collapse: collapse property to the table selector, which merged the borders into single, clean lines.
3. Styling the Contact Form Layout: Making the contact form look organized was difficult because the labels and input fields were bunching up together. It was hard to distinguish where one section ended and the next began. To fix this, I wrapped each input group in a <div> and applied bottom margins to create necessary whitespace and breathing room between the fields.
4. Creating a Circular Profile Image: I initially struggled with the profile picture because the square aspect ratio looked too rigid and plain against the text. I wanted it to look more modern and integrated into the design rather than just pasted onto the page. I resolved this by using the border-radius: 50% property to create a perfect circle and added a box-shadow to give it some depth.
5. Differentiating the Footer Area: Another challenge was making the footer feel like a distinct section separate from the main content of the page. It originally blended in too much with the white background of the body. I addressed this by giving the footer a dark background color that matched the header and adding a top border to clearly visually separate the end of the page.
6. Customizing Form Labels: I struggled with the form layout because applying a style to the generic label tag affected the radio buttons and checkboxes in a way I did not intend. This caused a layout issue where the small option labels looked identical to the main input headings, creating confusion in the design. I resolved this by using class selectors to group the main input labels together, which allowed me to apply unique styling to them without disrupting the appearance of the other labels.
